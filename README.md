# Hello, welcome to my profile! ✌️

I'm a Frontend Developer from Poland 🇵🇱  
Passionate about Web3 and Blockchain, focusing on the Internet Computer (ICP) network 🌐

My main tech stack includes TS & JS, React, Vue, Nuxt, Astro, Tailwind —

With a love for clean design,  
I craft minimalistic, user-friendly interfaces 💎
